<h3>24/7 Mode</h3>
<p>
  <b>So how does this 24/7 mode works?</b><br> The main target of 24/7 mode is to stay on a given specific voice channel for a long period of time even if there is playing nor none.<br><br>
  <b>But what if it's not enabled?</b> <br>Then it will disconnect/destroys the player when it ends the queue.<br><br>
  <b>So I've made autoplay enabled, doesn't that mean now it's 24/7 mode?</b><br> The answer is no, because the autoplay will be continue playing some random tracks but if the voice channel has no members on it and 24/7 mode is disabled, then after 60 seconds it will disconnect/destroys the player.<br><br>
  <b>What permission would the member/user or the bot should need?</b> <br>The member/user would need Manage Server/Guild Permission to perform this command and bot only needs some default permissions like Connect, Embed Links, Send Messages etc.<br><br>
  <b>What if I stop/disconnect/destroy the player manually?</b><br>
  If the 24/7 mode is enabled, then it will connecting to voice channel when it saved while running the 24/7 command.<br>
  If its not enabled then it will just disconnect/stop/destroys the player and clears the queue normally.<br><br>
  <b>What if I left the voice channel while playing a song?</b><br>
  If the voice channel doesn't have any members/users left and if the 24/7 mode is disabled, then it will wait for 60 seconds and disconnects the voice channel if there is no members/users left in the voice channel.<br>
  But if the 24/7 mode is enabled, then no matter what it will continue playing without any distrubance.<br><br>
  Now I think you got a little idea how the 24/7 mode works :)
