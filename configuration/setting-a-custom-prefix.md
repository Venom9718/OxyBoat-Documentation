# Setting a custom prefix

## Custom Prefix's

As I'm aware that you may have multiple bots in your server, even <mark style="color:purple;">`multiple OxyBoat's`</mark>. You may be inclined to change the prefix of OxyBoat so as not to interefere with any other bots you may have This can be achieved with <mark style="color:purple;">prefix set</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">`<newPrefix>`</mark>. In order to use spaces between your prefix and the command name it must be surrounded in quotes. e.g. prefix set "OxyBoat" which would make a command look like <mark style="color:purple;">OxyBoat play</mark>
