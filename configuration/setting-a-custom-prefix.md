# Setting a custom prefix

## Custom Prefix's

### As I'm aware that you may have multiple bots in your server, `even multiple OxyBoat's`. You may be inclined to change the prefix of OxyBoat so as not to interefere with any other bots you may have
This can be achieved with prefix set `<newPrefix>`.
In order to use spaces between your prefix and the command name it must be surrounded in quotes. e.g. prefix set "OxyBoat" which would make a command look like OxyBoat play
