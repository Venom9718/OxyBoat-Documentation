<h2>How can I play a song?</h2>
You can play a song by joining a voice channel and providing a search query (which is required) using either message command <u>play</u> or slash command <u>/play</u> with a search query. If you didn't provide any search query then it will give you a guide how to use this that specific play command. It supports <i>youtube, spotify, soundcloud, deezer and more</i>. If you provide a name, then it will search for that query in youtube and you will get three track selection options, you can choose any of it by clicking the buttons. If you don't select any in 60 seconds then it will load the first track loaded from the search result.
