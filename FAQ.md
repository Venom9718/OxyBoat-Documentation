<h2>How can I play a song?</h2>
<p>
You can play a song by joining a voice channel and providing a search query (which is required) using either message command <u>play</u> or slash command <u>/play</u>. If you didn't provide any search query then it will give you a guide how to use this that specific play command. It supports <i>youtube, spotify, soundcloud, deezer and more</i>. If you provide a name, then it will search for that query in youtube and you will get three track selection options, you can choose any of it by clicking the buttons. If you don't select any in 60 seconds then it will load the first track loaded from the search result.

<b>Usage:</b> ?play <query><br>

<h2>How can I get multiple search results for a query just than 3?</h2>
<p>
  You can get multiple search results for a query by just using <u>search</u> command in either message or slash command. This can get upto 20 or more results! You can select a track from it by just typing the number of song provided in the embed in the channel. If the number that you've given is invalid or more or less than the search result then it will cancel the search result! You can find a example down below!

<h2>How can I see the queue or queued songs?</h2>
<p>
  You can see the queue by just using <u>queue</u> command in either message or slash command. One page only contains 8 or 10 songs.

<h2>How can I skip the current playing?</h2>
<p>
  You can use <b>skip</b> command in either message or slash command. It just skips the current playing song.
  <br>
  But I can't, it just says "You don't have enough permission to use this command."! Why is it saying like this?
  <br>
  It's because you don't have "Deafen Members" Permission or don't have the dj role to perform this command (if there is a dj setup).
